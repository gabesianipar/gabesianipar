## ðŸ‘‹ there 

I'm Gabe and I'm a Computer Science/Business Admin student studying at USC!

I love building smart and handy full-stack solutions to relevant problems. My projects include building the Indonesian organization's website on campus and tackling other productivity tools such as email cleaning and clock in/clock out systems.
